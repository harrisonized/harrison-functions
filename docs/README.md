## Getting Started

Install Sphinx v3.2.1:

```
conda install -c anaconda sphinx=3.2.1
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
pip install rinohtype
```

Use `make html` to build the docs website. Then, navigate to `build/html/index.html` to read the docs.

Note: these docs are meant to be an encyclopedic reference. Example notebooks will be added in the future to highlight how to use some of the plotting functions.
